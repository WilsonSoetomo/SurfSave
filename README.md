# Portfolio

created a portfolio based on nice contrasting colors and wilson from castaway.

I tried looking for simple styled website examples and found 1 at chipotle.com

I wanted to google how to make cool navigation bar effects so I copied a sample of animation from stack overflow using javascript

I placed all sections based on divs for the mean time to get the overall layout of the website

I linked the nav buttons to the corresponding sections on the website

I google several references for flex placement as that was the hardest challenge for me.

I still have difficulties managing the message box in the bottom of the website. I could not get it to align to the right.
